### Big thanks to @lzhiyong for his development tools for termux!

Since the minimum version of the NDK for Termux is r23—Å, I had to figure it out and update some code in the Telegram project

- Download openjdk-11, android-sdk and ndk-r23c from here: https://github.com/lzhiyong/termux-ndk/releases
- Please follow the workspace preparation instructions: https://github.com/Lzhiyong/termux-ndk/tree/master/build-app
- Clone this repo & build Telegram
